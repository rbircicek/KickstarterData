# KickstarterData
## Overview of Project
   This project is about the list of movies with the given parent and subcategories. The numerical and categorical variables such as launch date and outcomes are given for each movie. We were asked to create Theater Outcomes by Launch date and Outcomes based on Goals analyses.    

### Purpose
    The Purpose was to create these two analyses using the skills obtained in Module 1. 

## Analysis and Challenges
   Working on two separate sheets and extracting the data from another sheet was a challenge for me. It took a while to figure out how to do it.
    
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    When we look at the over all data for all year and all categories successful outcome has a dominance among all outcomes. The least number of outcomes are the canceled ones.   

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    Goals for failed and successful outcomes have ups and downs. We can see a slightly increasing pattern for failed ones and decreasing pattern for the successful ones over the time. The percentage for canceled ones are slightly and clearly increasing over time.   

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
•	The data for each outcome are not clearly increasing or decreasing.
•	The number of successful outcomes is always greater than the number of other two outcomes.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
•	The biggest difference between percentage successful and failed is between 15,000 and 19,999. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
•	The parent categories and subcategories are not equally distributed.  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
•	Goal vs pledged
•	Outcomes vs country
•	Launch Month vs outcome
•	Staff Pick vs outcome
